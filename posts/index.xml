&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s human nature to get scared when there is change in the way we work. Be it the first day of school, first day in a new job, even when you get married, there’s always fear about how things will turn out in this new environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this fear comes when you are willing to do something which you wanted to do. Now let&amp;rsquo;s think what if we are forced to change. Now there will be more frustration than fear as change is imposed on us and we are not in control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is AI bubble coming?</title><link>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/is-ai-bubble-coming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/is-ai-bubble-coming/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the 90s we had the dot-com bubble. It was caused by the indefinite optimistic approach of the investors. They saw the internet as the future and invested in every other company which had dotcom in their name. Lot of them failed as they didn’t have any valuable product and they were just using dotcom movement to their advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came the cleantech bubble around 2008. Government announced heavy subsidies on companies which work towards green energy. Investors again became indefinitely optimistic and invested heavily on a lot of cleantech companies. Most companies were just selling different versions of the same core product like solar panels. There were few exceptions like Tesla which actually built real cleantech products and succeeded.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journey from 8xlarge to 2xlarge</title><link>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/journey-from-8xlarge-to-2xlarge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/journey-from-8xlarge-to-2xlarge/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are only 2 ways to make money. Increase your income or reduce your expense. Its true for inidividual as well as organizations. In my current organization we were facing huge challenge of unncessary cost being spent on AWS.

For me it is Coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After becoming a tech lead it was more about focusing on the design system and my team writing most of the code. It doesn’t mean I didn’t write any. I used to find some tasks which I can work on independently as I didn’t want to lose touch and I like to write code. But since then I never had a long uninterrupted streak of writing code. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After effect of Postgres DB upgrade</title><link>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/after-effect-of-postgres-db-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rupeshsharma.in/posts/after-effect-of-postgres-db-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Story:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Client reported that one of the reports which was getting generated in 15-20 mins is not taking ours.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We tried analysing the RDS performance insight and came to know IO:DataFileRead is taking time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Recently we upgraded the Postgres version from 12 to 15 on two of our projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We had two possible causes(still a theory)&lt;/p>
