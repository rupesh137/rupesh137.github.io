It was caused by the indefinite optimistic approach of the investors. They saw the internet as the future and invested in every other company which had dotcom in their name. Lot of them failed as they didn’t have any valuable product and they were just using dotcom movement to their advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came the cleantech bubble around 2008. Government announced heavy subsidies on companies which work towards green energy. Investors again became indefinitely optimistic and invested heavily on a lot of cleantech companies. Most companies were just selling different versions of the same core product like solar panels. There were few exceptions like Tesla which actually built real cleantech products and succeeded.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
